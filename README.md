# budget-tool
It's a budget tool. It's designed to track all of your bills, setting each bill to reocur based on frequency. The app shows you which bills are due between now and your next pay date. It tells you how much is left over at the end of this pay period. Or just choose a date you want to track bills through. This is a rough build, that needs to be cleaned up more. But for now, it solves my budgeting fiasco. ** Note, this only stores bills in your local storage at the moment until I can get around to setting it up in a database based on user. Create a copy of all your bills in an excel spreadsheet if you're afraid to lose them.
